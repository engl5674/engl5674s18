## Description

I call these use-annotations, since I ask you to first summarize the text and subsequently consider how to apply it. Writing annotations is an integral skill for scholars to understand their colleagues’ arguments. The process implicates you in a particular rhetorical engagement with the texts that you read, since you must summarize these texts in a way that imagines the author(s) audiences and purposes, but we must also imagine how to apply it in our own professional contexts. To fulfill these needs, the annotations must include the following 2 main parts with respective properties:

### Annotation structure
**Paragraph 1 -- Recasting the argument:**
1. State the main problem and purpose.
2. State the main argument.
3. Summarize what claims build the scholar’s case. This can manifest in numerous ways in rhetorical scholarship. Here are some possible strategies that we will come across:
  - Draws from previous research to define a research problem.
  - Uses some combination of theory and "method" to respond to such a problem.
  - States what implications and conclusions can be drawn, due to their findings or argument.

**Paragraph 2 -- Application and discussion:**
- Make connections with prior readings, which can help you develop a methodology;
- Ask questions about sources of confusion, disagreement, or what you deem as important; and/or
- Consider potential ideas and questions about how to apply or respond.

## Logistics

- ~300-400 words, unless otherwise noted.
- Uses my "brand" of APA in which you cite the page numbers of particular places of the text, while avoiding direct quotation.
- Due before class in the designated Google Drive folder.

## Rubric

- Adheres to the format, structure, and citation style noted above. (Page numbers throughout are vital components!)
- Demonstrates engagement with the arguments and aspects of the text.

You will receive either a Pass or Fail for each annotation. I will provide feedback that helps orient you to what issues need to be addressed, if necessary.
