## Description

I call these use-annotations, since I ask you to first summarize the text and subsequently consider how to apply it. Writing annotations is an integral skill for scholars to understand their colleagues’ arguments. The process implicates you in a particular rhetorical engagement with the texts that you read, since you must summarize these texts in a way that imagines the author(s) audiences and purposes, but we must also imagine how to apply it in our own professional contexts. To fulfill these needs, the annotations must include the following 2 main parts with respective properties:

### Annotation structure
**Paragraph 1 -- Recasting the argument:**
1. State the main problem and purpose.
2. State the main argument.
3. Summarize what claims build the scholar’s case. This can manifest in numerous ways in rhetorical scholarship. Here are some possible strategies that we will come across:
  - Draws from previous research to define a research problem.
  - Uses some combination of theory and "method" to respond to such a problem.
  - States what implications and conclusions can be drawn, due to their findings or argument.

**Paragraph 2 -- Application and discussion:**
- Make connections with prior readings, which can help you develop a methodology;
- Ask questions about sources of confusion, disagreement, or what you deem as important; and/or
- Consider potential ideas and questions about how to apply or respond.

See this <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ebbyN0oJB4BzQDDjCxF32Of7RoTBILH6cBbQyHts-n4/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">example</a> for your reference.

## Logistics

- ~300-400 words, unless otherwise noted.
- Write 10 total sets of use-annotations: 7 sets prior to Spring Break; then 3 more individual annotations during your individual study.
- Uses my "brand" of APA in which you cite the page numbers of particular places of the text, while avoiding direct quotation.
- Due before class in 2 designated Google Drive folders. The first will be shared just before class within our shared Google Drive folder. The second will be shared with me within your personal Drive folder for review purposes. Accordingly, please create the following baseline structure-scheme for this class in your VT Google Drive:
<pre>
      /engl5674s18-[last name][firstname initial]
        /annotations
          wk1-[author-lastname]-[author-lastname]
</pre>

## Rubric

- Adheres to the format, structure, and citation style noted above. (Page numbers throughout are vital components!)
- Demonstrates engagement with the arguments and aspects of the text.

You will receive either a Pass or Fail for each annotation set. A set encompasses the total annotations for that particular week. I will provide feedback that helps orient you to what issues need to be addressed, if necessary.
