## Description

I call these use-annotations, since I ask you to first summarize the text and subsequently consider how to apply it. Annotations serve a few important purposes for this course, but also more generally. First, writing annotations is an integral skill for scholars to understand their colleagues’ arguments. The process forces a particular rhetorical engagement. However, it is important to always remember that you play an important role in shaping this rhetorical situation. We must summarize these texts in a way that imagines the authors audiences and purposes, but we can also imagine how to apply it in our own contexts. The annotations must include the following 2 main parts with respective properties:

### Annotation structure
**Paragraph 1 -- Recasting the argument:**
- State the main argument
- Summarize what claims build the scholar’s case. This can manifest in numerous ways in rhetorical scholarship. Here are some possible strategies that we will come across:
  - Draws from previous research to define a research problem.
  - Uses some combination of theory and "method" to respond to such a problem
  - States what implications and conclusions can be drawn, due to their findings or argument.

**Paragraph 2 -- Application and discussion:**
- Make connections with prior readings, which can help you develop a methodology;
- Ask questions about sources of confusion, disagreement, or what you deem as important; and/or
- Consider potential ideas and questions about how to apply something.

## Logistics

- ~300-400 words, unless otherwise noted.
- Uses my "brand" of APA in which you cite the page numbers of particular places of the text, while avoiding direct quotation.
- Due before class in the designated Google Drive folder.

## Rubric

- Adheres to the format, structure, and citation style noted above. (Page numbers throughout are vital components!)
- Demonstrates engagement with the arguments and aspects of the text.

You will receive either a Pass or Fail for each annotation. I will provide feedback that helps orient you to what issues need to be addressed, if necessary.
