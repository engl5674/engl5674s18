## Description

Near the end of phase 1 of the course, we will shift our attention to constructing qualitative data for your autoethnographies. Each week you will gather artifacts and write fieldnotes and memos to help you:

- Initially figure out your research problem and question: What your project will focus on,
- Continue to narrow the focus of your AREX project,
- Integrate particular readings from the first phase of the course with your rhetorical exeriences with technology, and
- Any other aspects that you deem important along the way.

## Grading and Logistics

- Upload fieldnotes _at least_ 2 days per week, but write them as needed.
- Fieldnotes will vary in length, but should be as descriptive and detailed about some-thing or some event pertinent to your project.
- Upload _at least 3_ conceptual memos before every class on Wednesday.
- Memos can be quick notes about conceptual connections, but can also be freeform writing/drawing combinations to help you think through particular experiences in connection with the literature.
- Consistency is key and is the main focus of the grade. I will provide comments, suggestions, questions, and nudges here and there, wherever I see that I can offer help. Take note, though, that these writings are for your projects, so the quality, candor, and earnestness of them will ultimately shape your AREX project. The less you engage these writings, the less developed will your AREX project be.
- Please create the following baseline structure for your project's directory on Google Drive: <pre>
autoeth-[last name][firstname initial]
|--fieldnotes
|--memos</pre>
- Then, invite me as an editor to this folder.
- Feel free to invite each other to your Drive folders, so you can comment on particular ideas, memos, sets of texts, etc. This is not required, but a good additional feedback mechanism.
