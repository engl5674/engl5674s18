## Description

In this final project, you will make decisions about how all of your media elements come together into a cohesive narrative. You will learn about some fundamental HTML elements and their relationships and behaviors programmed with CSS. In short, you will write a web-ready narrative within a single-page website format.

## Writing tools

- Github <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">account</a> & <a href="https://desktop.github.com/" target="_blank">desktop application</a> for hosting and versioning your website.
- <span id="localhost-install">Localhost web server via Python in the Terminal (Mac) / CommandPrompt (Windows):</span> <code>python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000</code> for Python 2.7 &amp; <code>python -m http.server 8000</code> for Python 3.
  - <b>For Mac computers</b>, you should have Python pre-installed. If not, follow the directions below:
    - Open the Terminal
    - Install HomeBrew -- a package manager -- by following the instructions in this video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lI_2DWnYo8o" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lI_2DWnYo8o</a>.
    - After installing Homebrew, while still in the open terminal, install Python 3 by simply typing the following command: <code>brew install python3</code>. This will take a minute or two.
  - <b>For Windows</b>, follow the <em>Python 3</em> installation instruction on this page: <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/197947/how-to-install-python-on-windows/" target="_blank">How to Geek</a>.<br/><br/><em>Be sure to choose the option to add a PATH variable</em>.<br/><br/><img style="width=70%" src="/images/python-install-win.png" />

## General process

1. Learn how to set up and use a web-writing environment.
2. Learn about and apply basic architectural and folder-naming and file-naming conventions for a single-page website.
3. Learn about and apply basic HTML <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> elements, and the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>, its block and inline elements, and their <code>display</code> properties and behaviors.
4. Learn about and apply basic CSS element selection and styling &amp; the CSS <code>Grid</code> display.
5. Develop and refine your data-story narrative content.

## Rubric

- Website amplifies a particular set of insights about your online practices and how digital data are intertwined with it.
- CSS Grid is written cleanly (spacing, syntax, and structure) and has aptly named tags, IDs, and classes.
- HTML Markup:
  - Conveys knowledge of block-level vs. inline-level elements; and
  - Passes HTML5 validation test.
- CSS sheet:
  - Structure of document reflects hierarchy of HTML within sheet; and
  - Provides consistent commenting scheme.
- Simple and readable typography styles and hierarchy. Aesthetic matches your narrative.
- Integrates text, visuals, and videos as a cohesive narrative about your digital practice / life.
