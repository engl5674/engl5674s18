Rhetoricians still seem to be coping with how to study and theorize the rhetorical relationship between people and technologies. The ancient art of rhetoric was originally developed within a particular city-state and focuses on the use of speech. In this class, I am challenging us to consider how we dwell in a very different <em>polis</em> (city-state): a place where businesses and governments have invested in a global infrastructure of networked databases that perform operations with user-data.  Consider some of the following differences between speech communication and contemporary communication mediated by digital and computaitonal technologies:

- Since different people are delivered different content with the same applications, can an interface or device be analyzed with concepts derived about speech interactions or the study of texts?
- How about networked databases or machine-learning algorithms that such devices employ?

In response to these questions, we will survey, interrogate, and apply developing bodies of rhetorical approaches to theorizing the rhetorics of technology that integrate with the linguistic-textual. Our shared main aim involves understanding how traditionally theorized and practiced rhetorics should be intertwined with the study of our everyday, digital practices that are distributed across diverse contexts of political, social, and rhetorical work.

In this class, I am challenging us to consider how we dwell in a reconfigured polis (city-state)—a place where businesses and governments have invested in a global infrastructure of networked databases that perform operations with user-data. What can be learned about such an infrastructure, when we realize that user-data are not discretely confined to singular purposes, but multiple and rhetorical? Let’s put that far-reaching fact into some situations:

- Recently, [Netflix trolled 54 of their users](https://twitter.com/netflix/status/940051734650503168?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&ref_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.businessinsider.com%2Fnetflix-says-some-people-are-watching-a-christmas-prince-every-day-2017-12) who watched a particular movie everyday for 2 weeks ([Wittmer, 2017](http://www.businessinsider.com/netflix-says-some-people-are-watching-a-christmas-prince-every-day-2017-12)). Whether or not Netflix made this information up, how are data being analyzed in unregulated ways at Netflix or any other networked application (Uber<sup>[1](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/08/29/547113818/uber-ends-its-controversial-post-ride-tracking-of-users-location),[2](https://www.revealnews.org/article/uber-said-it-protects-you-from-spying-security-sources-say-otherwise/)</sup>, [Tinder](https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/28/someone-scraped-40000-tinder-selfies-to-make-a-facial-dataset-for-ai-experiments/), etc.)?
- Facebook has been investing and accepting money from businesses<sup>[1](https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-advertising-discrimination-housing-race-sex-national-origin),[2](https://www.ted.com/talks/zeynep_tufekci_we_re_building_a_dystopia_just_to_make_people_click_on_ads)</sup> and politicians<sup>[1](https://medium.com/startup-grind/how-the-trump-campaign-built-an-identity-database-and-used-facebook-ads-to-win-the-election-4ff7d24269ac),[2](http://www.bbc.com/news/av/magazine-40852227/the-digital-guru-who-helped-donald-trump-to-the-presidency)</sup> to develop tailor-made psychographically curated audiences to target fine-grained audiences for sometimes unethical purposes.
- Facebook and Twitter enable politicians the ability to [block citizens](https://www.propublica.org/article/governors-and-federal-agencies-are-blocking-accounts-on-facebook-and-twitter?utm_campaign=sprout&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&utm_content=1512769907) from their pages and accounts.
- U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) plans to [advance social media surveillance strategies](https://www.propublica.org/article/extreme-digital-vetting-of-visitors-to-the-u-s-moves-forward-under-a-new-name).
- Hundreds of thousands of American identities were stolen and used to spam the latest FCC Net Neutrality commenting site with pro-repeal opinions ([Kao, 2017](https://hackernoon.com/more-than-a-million-pro-repeal-net-neutrality-comments-were-likely-faked-e9f0e3ed36a6)).

I am asking us all to take a step back, pause, and consider the following important question: **How can and should we, as rhetoricians, study such a digital infrastructure with very different metes and bounds than those of rhetoric’s origins in ancient Athens?**

I suggest that we start by reflecting on our own position within this rhetorical landscape. By better understanding our own relationship with our everyday digital, networked technologies, we can ask better questions, develop better methodologies, and produce more substantive rhetorical theories for our time. To accomplish this goal, we will examine rhetorical and STS theories that have been and have yet to be integrated with that of mediation, activity, feminist, queer, and race. Graded projects will include weekly annotations during the first half of the course, as a method to prime our class discussions. Additionally, the annotations will help each student work toward the construction of their own rhetorical methodology. In the second half of the course, students will apply these methodologies in a small-scale autoethnography about their own rhetorical experiences with a networked technology. Students will come away from the course with the following: 1) foundational knowledge about emerging methodologies in rhetorics of technology, 2) a pilot of their own methodology, and 3) preliminary insights about their own rhetorical experiences with a networked technology. *PhD students will also be required to articulate implications that their projects have for rhetoric by writing about their methodology and preliminary findings*.

## How 5674 differs from a methods course

ENGL 5674 differs from traditional methods courses in the latters survey a variety of methods. In methods courses, students typically must dig deeper into methods of their own particular interest. In this course, I ask you to learn autoethnographic methods for the specific objectives outlined in the next section.
