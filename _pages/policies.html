  <h2>Grading &amp; Project Policies</h2>

  <h3>Revisions</h3>
    <p>
      Revisions are a major part of this course. You will receive feedback from your peers and myself, so you can revise the following projects for a better grade:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Data Visualization</li>
      <li>
        Video(s)</li>
    </ul>

  <h3>Grading guidelines</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>A: 100-94%, A-: 90-93%: "A" work exceeds basic assignment criteria in several ways.</li>
      <li>B+: 87-89%, B: 84-86%, B-: 80-83%: "B" work meets and exceeds basic assignment criteria</li>
      <li>C+: 77-79%, C: 74-76%, C-: 70-73%: "C" work meets basic assignment criteria.</li>
      <li>D+: 67-69%, D: 64-66%, D-: 60-63%: "D" work fails to meet one or more basic assignment criteria.</li>
      <li>F: 0-59%: "F" work is incomplete, not received, or fails to meet any basic assignment criteria.</li>
    </ul>

  <h3>Deadlines/Late work</h3>
    <p>
      Final drafts handed in after their due dates will be <strong>reduced half a letter grade</strong>, unless prior arrangements are made with me. After 2 days, the grade lowered a full-letter grade, and another full-letter grade for the third. A fourth day results in an automatic failure. However, life happens, and if you require extra time to complete your project, contact me <strong>prior to the assignment deadline</strong>.

  <h2>Class Attendance and Participation</h2>

  <p>
    This is a highly collaborative course, and I expect you to fulfill your fair share of group work and to interact courteously with your peers at all times. Most of our class sessions will be conducted in discussion/workshop format, and many of these workshops cannot be recreated outside of class, so regular attendance and active participation are important.
  </p>
  <p>
    My attendance policy is simple: you may miss 3 classes (for any reason) without penalty. Each additional absence (for any reason) will lower your course grade by 5%, and six or more absences may result in a failing grade for the course. Because our time in class is limited, promptness is important. Each tardy (arriving more than 5 minutes late) and each instance of leaving early will count as 1/2 of an absence. If you are late for class, it is your responsibility to ensure that you have not been marked absent.

<section id="honor-code">
  <h2>Undergraduate Honor Code</h2>

  <p>
    The Undergraduate Honor Code pledge that each member of the university community agrees to abide by states:
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    As a Hokie, I will conduct myself with honor and integrity at all times. I will not lie, cheat, or steal, nor will I accept the actions of those who do.
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    Students enrolled in this course are responsible for abiding by the Honor Code. A student who has doubts about how the Honor Code applies to any assignment is responsible for obtaining specific guidance from the course instructor before submitting the assignment for evaluation. Ignorance of the rules does not exclude any member of the University community from the requirements and expectations of the Honor Code. For additional information about the Honor Code, please visit: <a href="https://www.honorsystem.vt.edu/" target="_blank">https://www.honorsystem.vt.edu/</a>.
