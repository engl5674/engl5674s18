  <h2>Classroom Conduct</h2>
    <p>
      <small>Original author: Dr. Sano-Franchini</small>
    </p>
    <p>
      All course participants are expected to be respectful of academic and personal differences that are present in this classroom and in our conversations, discussions, and interactions with one another. Anyone who exhibits disrespectful behavior will be asked to leave, and I will strongly recommend your removal from the course. In addition to a general standard of mutual respect in this classroom, all participants are asked to adhere to the following classroom policies:
    </p>
    <div class="emphases">
      <h3>Respectful and Empathic Listening</h3>
        <p>
          Effective dialogue hinges on our ability to listen with the goal of understanding and building connections—even if we disagree with what is being said. To work toward understanding, we will respect that each person’s perspectives are valid, and that they come from a legitimate place. If we don’t understand those perspectives, we will ask questions and avoid making silent judgements.
        </p>
      <h3>Personal Responsibility</h3>
      <p>
        We will use "I statements" (such as "I believe that...) rather than generalizing or provoking (but don't you think..?).
      </p>
      <h3>Collective Responsibility</h3>
      <p>
        We will speak for ourselves and not for others (including groups to which we belong). Likewise, we will respond to content rather than personalize comments that are made.
      </p>
      <h3>Mindfulness</h3>
      <p>
        We will be mindful of our personal impact on the group. Dominating discussions, interrupting others, arriving late, texting on your phone, checking social media, and eating or drinking noisily are examples of having a negative impact.
      </p>
      <h3>Confidentiality</h3>
      <p>
        Any sensitive information about individuals shared during class discussion remains in the classroom.
      </p>
      <h3>Ongoing Development</h3>
      <p>
        We will review our classroom protocol regularly to insure that we are meeting our expectations, and to determine if additional guidelines are needed.

  <h2>Undergraduate Honor Code</h2>

  <p>
    The Undergraduate Honor Code pledge that each member of the university community agrees to abide by states:
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    As a Hokie, I will conduct myself with honor and integrity at all times. I will not lie, cheat, or steal, nor will I accept the actions of those who do.
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    Students enrolled in this course are responsible for abiding by the Honor Code. A student who has doubts about how the Honor Code applies to any assignment is responsible for obtaining specific guidance from the course instructor before submitting the assignment for evaluation. Ignorance of the rules does not exclude any member of the University community from the requirements and expectations of the Honor Code. For additional information about the Honor Code, please visit: <a href="https://www.honorsystem.vt.edu/" target="_blank">https://www.honorsystem.vt.edu/</a>.
