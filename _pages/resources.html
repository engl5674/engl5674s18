  <h3>Reading Strategies</h3>
  <small>Original tips created by Dr. Mars Hicks.</small>
    <p>
      If you're having trouble keeping up with the reading for this class, here are some tips that may help you read faster and retain more:
    </p>
    <ol class="hokie-shade">
      <li>
        Don’t read in a decontextualized, content-driven fashion. Instead, read for argument: What is their argument? How do they support it? Who do they seem to be responding to and why?
      </li>
      <li>
        Write it [the argument] down. Creative and well-organized note-taking is what enables you to join the discussion more confidently, because no one expects anyone to recall such details on the spot.
      </li>
      <li>
        Figure out what details are important by seeing if they align, or conflict, with the scholar’s argument.
      </li>
      <li>
        Be able to formulate your own response to the scholar by using evidence from their text. You don't have to agree with their argument, but you should be able to point to specific parts of the text to show why you do or don't adhere to the author(s).
      </li>
      <li>
        Again, take notice about how good note-taking is your best practice.
      </li>
      <li>
        Jot down what your big takeaways were and consider what the author intended as such. This can help you see what you and the author have accomplished.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reading dense material is a process, and you'll get better at it if you just commit and do the work. Our class discussions are part of the process, which will help you grasp what you read.
      </li>
      <li>
        Lastly, if you don’t get parts of a text, mark these places and questions. Again, write it down for taking it up in class. Good researchers organize their ideas to facilitate such discussion.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Note: These tips are also useful for reverse-engineering and dissecting successful writing, and for figuring out how to write your own papers.
